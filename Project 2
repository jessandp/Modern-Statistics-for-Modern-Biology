# A Comparitive Study of Clustering Algorithms on Retinal Cell Gene Expression Data
# 1. Selecting two clustering algorithms
# Task 1: Select two clustering algorithms for data with over 10,000 dimensions

# Choosing the number of clusters
# Task 2: Selecting number of clusters (Choosing two internal cluster quality measures)

# 3. Simulating data with complex clusters (Variables = sample size / dimensions / number of clusters)
# Task 3: Simulate  datasets with various sample sizes, dimensions, and number of clusters (small vs large)

# 4. Performance evaluation on simulated datasets (Clustering accuracy)
# Task 4.1: Use ARI to report the performance of algorithms as a function of sample size, dimesnion, and number of clusters in the ground truth. (Plot functions as curves and 2 algorithms and 2 internal measures in one plot for comparison)

# Runtime
# Task 4.2: Report the runtime of each of the four setups as functions of sample size and dimension

# 5. Clusters of Cells in developing mouse retina
# Task 5.1: Evaluate the quality of. 40 raw clusters and 7 cell types from the paper using the two internal cluster measures you have chosen

# Task 5.2: Apply the four options in to cluster the cells and report the internal cluster quality

# Task 5.3: Determine the discrepancy between your clusterings against the 40 raw clusters and 7 cell types in the paper using ARI

# 6. Discussion
# Task 6: Summarize your results on both the simulated and real data. Discuss challenges in clustering high dimensional data
